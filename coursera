Because I just graduated and I am searching for jobs. I don't have enough income to be able to afford paying for these courses myself. Meanwhile, looking at the job market and the trend of technology, specially big data and data science area, I think learning this course material would help me to find a better job. It would be another feather in I can have on my hat. I want to work for big companies and working for big companies I need to be able to work with large scale data. I really don’t understand why it should be a certain length of statement.  I am wondering what happens if I just copy past whatever I wrote above.  But I want to say thank you for providing this opportunity for people like me who can’t afford paying for external courses to apply for financial aid. It is a blessing. God may bless you and America. 

Looking at the job market and the trend of technology, specially big data and data science area, I think learning this course material would help me to find a better job. It would be another feather in I can have on my hat. I want to work for big companies and working for big companies I need to be able to work with large scale data. I want to be a modeler. Specially I like to work for fraud detection departments. As far as I know right now they are not using modern approaches for this task to prevent fraud. I want to use deep learning approaches for example image processing to prevent fraud. But to do this I need to know how to work with a cluster to handle big queries and data manipulations.  Again I want to say thank you for providing this opportunity for people like me who can’t afford paying for external courses to apply for financial aid. It is a blessing. God may bless you and America. 

Because I just graduated from grad school. I am searching for jobs. I don't have enough income to be able to afford paying for these courses myself. I already have a lot of debts to pay and I don’t want to make it more.
